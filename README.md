# WordCounting
#Task Description
- We have a directory with the path ./directory_big that contains subdirectories and files at varying depths. Each directory and its subdirectories have a property called rctime, which represents the most recent modification time of any file within that directory or its subdirectories.

#Objective
- Identify Modified Files: Given a specific timestamp, quickly find all files within the directory structure that have been modified after this timestamp.

- Word Count Calculation: For the identified files, count the occurrences of English words (case-sensitive) within the file contents.
